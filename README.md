# NotificationAPI

The is a Web API created in ASP.NET Core, by using Entity Framework Core. It interacts with a SQL Server DB and provides data to the React-based frontend. 
I used this project as a demo to explore how to integrate React with .Net Core API, by keeping both of them completely separate.
